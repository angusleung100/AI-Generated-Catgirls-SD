# AI-Generated-Catgirls-SD
Repository for notebooks and documentation for my "Making AI-Generated Catgirls (As a CS grad)" series on Youtube.

## About The Project / Series

These notebooks are part of a multi-part project that compares different approaches to consistent AI image generation.

The methods for consistent AI image generation used are:

Method 1: Image-to-Image Generation Using a Base Image
Method 2: Fine-tuning SD1.5 with similar images until it generates somewhat consistently

Join me as I use my newly acquired CS degree as I set off to create AI-generated cat girls because I have no idea what I'm doing as a currently unemployed (as of this series) CS grad!
